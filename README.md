Kimbap is an alternative module of Sugar for processing Chargebee subscriptions for Beemo. It handles specifically the 
webhook requests from Chargebee, collects the important information before sending off a Kafka message down for other 
modules to handle the change.

#### üì¶ Setup

> **Warning**
> This assumes that the `.env` is configured properly and contains all the properties 
> that are needed. If not, please ensure that is done first.
> 




In order to set up Kimbap, you first have to build the Docker image by running the following:
```shell
docker build -t kimbap .
```

Once the image is built, you can start the container by running the following command:
```shell
docker run --name kimbap -p [server_port]:[server_port] --env-file .env kimbap
```

> **Note**
> `[server_port]` should be the server port that you configured on the configuration 
> since that is what Kimbap uses.

### üêù Setting up with Chargebee

Before we can start receiving events from Chargebee, we have to configure Chargebee itself and to do that, let us 
first follow the steps:
1. Create a READ_ONLY key (can be found on the `/apikeys_and_webhooks/api` path of your Chargebee site) and install it into your configuration.
2. Add Kimbap into the webhooks (can be located on `/apikeys_and_webhooks/webhooks` path of your Chargebee site) and select the [following events](#-chargebee-events) plus configure the basic authentication.
3. Kimbap should now start receiving events.

### üî• Chargebee Events

The following events needed to be selected (nothing more, nothing less) to have Kimbap work:
- [x] Subscription Created
- [x] Subscription Created with Backdating
- [x] Subscription Reactivated
- [x] Subscription Reactivated with Backdating
- [x] Subscription Started
- [x] Subscription Paused
- [x] Subscription Cancelled
- [x] Subscription Resumed

### üç© Adding more plans

In cases when more plans are to-be-added, we can support them by modifying the `configs/plans.json`. All the samples that you need 
should be there, but to elaborate, you have to create a new object in the file with the following properties:
- **name**: the name of the plan and also what should be sent to Kafka.
- **ids**: the plans in Chargebee that would trigger this plan activation.

Note that the `none` name is reserved for cancellations.
