Kimbap is an alternative module of Sugar for processing Chargebee subscriptions for Beemo. It handles specifically the 
webhook requests from Chargebee, collects the important information before sending off a Kafka message down for other 
modules to handle the change.

#### üì¶ Setup

> **Warning**
> This assumes that the `.env` is configured properly and contains all the properties 
> that are needed. If not, please ensure that is done first.
> 
> Additionally, make sure that this does not use the same database as Tea or any existing project, it can be on the same 
> instance, but ensure that the database itself is different. Prisma will ask you to reset the database 
> if that happens, that's when you know it's the same table.

In order to set up Kimbap, you first have to build the Docker image by running the following:
```shell
docker build -t kimbap .
```

Once the image is built, you can start the container by running the following command:
```shell
docker run --name kimbap -p [server_port]:[server_port] --env-file .env kimbap
```

> **Note**
> `[server_port]` should be the server port that you configured on the configuration 
> since that is what Kimbap uses.

### üêù Setting up with Chargebee

Before we can start receiving events from Chargebee, we have to configure Chargebee itself and to do that, let us 
first follow the steps:
1. Create a READ_ONLY key (can be found on the `/apikeys_and_webhooks/api` path of your Chargebee site) and install it into your configuration.
2. Add Kimbap into the webhooks (can be located on `/apikeys_and_webhooks/webhooks` path of your Chargebee site) and select the [following events](#-chargebee-events) plus configure the basic authentication.
3. Kimbap should now start receiving events.
